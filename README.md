# Project Management Web Application

This is a simple project management web application that allows users to create and manage tasks.

## Running the Application Locally

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Building the Docker Image and Running a Container

To build the Docker image and run a container using the image, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Docker installed on your machine.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

3. Build the Docker image .

4. Once the image is built successfully, run a container using the image:

5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application running in the Docker container.

## Assumptions and Decisions

During the development process, the following assumptions and decisions were made:

1. **Technology Stack:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were chosen for development due to their simplicity and ease of use for building a minimal viable product (MVP).

2. **Styling:** Basic CSS styling was applied to make the application visually appealing and user-friendly. Further enhancements can be made based on feedback and requirements.

3. **Functionality:** The application provides basic functionalities such as adding tasks, viewing tasks, and marking tasks as completed. Additional features can be implemented in future iterations based on user feedback and business needs.

4. **Dockerization:** Docker was chosen for containerization to ensure the application is easily deployable and scalable across different environments. The Dockerfile was created to define the container environment and dependencies required to run the application.

5. **Documentation:** Clear and concise documentation was provided to guide users on running the application locally, building the Docker image, and running a container using the image. Assumptions and decisions made during the development process were documented to provide insights into the project's development journey.
